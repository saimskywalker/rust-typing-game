## Session: Core Game Mechanics Fixes
**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (7/7 tasks completed)  
**Priority**: High
**Archived**: 2025-08-15

### Description
Critical fixes for typing game core functionality including timer mechanics, sentence flow, calculation accuracy, and session persistence.

### Issues Identified
1. **Timer Direction**: Currently counts up instead of down, needs configurable countdown (60s default)
2. **Sentence Flow**: Manual button press required, should auto-load next sentence
3. **WPM & Accuracy Calculation**: NaN values appearing, need robust division-by-zero protection
4. **Stats Persistence**: Values reset on sentence change, should accumulate for full session

### Tasks Created
- **#T-001** [BUG] [HIGH] Implement countdown timer with configurable start time (60s default) ✅
- **#T-002** [FEATURE] [HIGH] Add automatic game stop when timer reaches zero ✅  
- **#T-003** [FEATURE] [MEDIUM] Implement automatic sentence loading after completion ✅
- **#T-004** [BUG] [HIGH] Fix WPM calculation to prevent NaN values ✅
- **#T-005** [BUG] [HIGH] Fix accuracy calculation to prevent NaN values ✅  
- **#T-006** [FEATURE] [MEDIUM] Implement session-wide stats accumulation ✅
- **#T-007** [FEATURE] [LOW] Add game restart functionality that resets accumulated stats ✅

### Dependencies
```
#T-002 depends on #T-001 (timer must exist before auto-stop)
#T-006 depends on #T-004, #T-005 (stats must be accurate before accumulating)
#T-007 depends on #T-006 (restart requires session stats to exist)
```

### Technical Implementation Notes
- **Timer Logic**: Modify Rust `TypingGame` struct to track countdown instead of elapsed time
- **WPM Formula**: `(total_typed_chars / 5) / (elapsed_time_minutes)` with zero-division checks
- **Accuracy Formula**: `(correct_chars / total_typed_chars) * 100.0` with zero-division checks
- **Session Stats**: Add accumulator fields to maintain running totals across sentences
- **Auto-flow**: Remove modal delays, immediately load new sentence on completion

### Files Modified
- `src/lib.rs` - Core timer and calculation logic
- `app.js` - UI timer display and sentence flow
- `index.html` - Timer display elements
- `style.css` - Timer styling updates

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for calculation edge cases (zero division)
- Integration tests for timer countdown behavior
- E2E tests for sentence auto-flow
- Manual testing with various typing speeds

### Acceptance Criteria (All Completed)
- [x] Timer counts down from 60 seconds by default
- [x] Game auto-stops at 0 seconds with final stats
- [x] New sentences load automatically after completion
- [x] WPM never displays NaN during typing
- [x] Accuracy never displays NaN during typing  
- [x] Stats accumulate across multiple sentences
- [x] Restart button resets all accumulated stats
- [x] Live stats update smoothly during typing

### Completion Summary
This session successfully addressed all critical game mechanics issues. The typing game now has:
- Proper countdown timer functionality
- Robust WPM and accuracy calculations
- Seamless sentence flow
- Session-wide statistics tracking
- Reliable restart functionality

**Impact**: Transformed the game from basic prototype to fully functional typing experience.
