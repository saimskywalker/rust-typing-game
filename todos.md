## Task Details

### T-001: Implement countdown timer with configurable start time
**Type**: BUG | **Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Timer currently counts up instead of down. Need configurable countdown (60s default).
**Files**: `src/lib.rs`, `app.js`, `index.html`
**Acceptance**: Timer displays countdown from 60s, configurable start time

### T-002: Add automatic game stop when timer reaches zero  
**Type**: FEATURE | **Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Game should automatically stop and show final stats when timer hits 0.
**Dependencies**: T-001 must be completed first
**Acceptance**: Game stops at 0:00, shows final WPM/accuracy

### T-003: Implement automatic sentence loading after completion
**Type**: FEATURE | **Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Description**: Remove manual "New Sentence" button requirement, auto-load next sentence.
**Acceptance**: New sentence appears immediately after completing current one

### T-004: Fix WPM calculation to prevent NaN values
**Type**: BUG | **Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: WPM displays NaN during typing. Use formula: (total_typed_chars / 5) / (elapsed_time_minutes)
**Files**: `src/lib.rs`
**Acceptance**: WPM never shows NaN, updates live during typing

### T-005: Fix accuracy calculation to prevent NaN values
**Type**: BUG | **Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Accuracy shows NaN% during typing. Use: (correct_chars / total_typed_chars) * 100.0
**Files**: `src/lib.rs`  
**Acceptance**: Accuracy never shows NaN%, updates live during typing

### T-006: Implement session-wide stats accumulation
**Type**: FEATURE | **Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Description**: Stats reset on sentence change, should accumulate for whole session.
**Dependencies**: T-004, T-005 must be completed first
**Acceptance**: WPM and accuracy accumulate across sentences until restart

### T-007: Add game restart functionality
**Type**: FEATURE | **Priority**: LOW  
**Description**: Add restart button that resets all accumulated session stats.
**Dependencies**: T-006 must be completed first
**Acceptance**: Restart button resets accumulated stats, starts fresh session

### T-008: Fix auto-continue to prevent over-typing and ensure immediate sentence progression
**Type**: BUG | **Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Users can type beyond sentence length without auto-continue triggering. Need to prevent over-typing and ensure immediate progression.
**Files**: `app.js`, `src/lib.rs`
**Acceptance**: Game stops accepting input at sentence length and immediately moves to next sentence
